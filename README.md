# companies_contacts

Details  
Create a contacts website to save organizations and people in those organizations. 
Fields like first_name, last_name, title, organization (auto-complete), summary, full_text_bio, url, picture, etc.    
Use MVC architecture, active_record, and write to Postgres.  Deploy to Heroku.  
Have one profile for the organization, and a profile for the people working in the organization.  
From the organization's main page in the site, user can click a button to add a person to that organization.    
There should be a way for user to edit organizations and people.  
Keep an edit log for each record. (i.e. updated by 'mickey' on 4/23/2016').
